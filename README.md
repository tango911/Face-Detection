# Face Detection
Face detection is a computer technology being used in a variety of applications that identifies human faces in digital images. Face detection also refers to the psychological process by which humans locate and attend to faces in a visual scene.
## Face Detection by OpenCV
#### Haar Classifier
The Haar Classifier is a machine learning based approach, an algorithm created by Paul Viola and Michael Jones; which (as mentioned before) are trained from many many positive images (with faces) and negatives images (without faces).
                                                                                                                                           
It starts by extracting Haar features from each image as shown by the windows below:
